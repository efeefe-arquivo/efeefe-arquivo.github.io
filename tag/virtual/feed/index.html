&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;Deleuze speaks not of &#039;realization&#039; but of actualization, and
introduces a novel ontological category to refer to the status of
multiplicities themselves: virtuality. This term does not refer, of
course, to the virtual reality which digital simulations have made so
familiar, but to a real virtuality forming a vital component of the
objective world. As he writes [in Difference and Repetition]:

The virtual is not opposed to the real but to the actual. The virtual
is fully real in so far as it is virtual… Indeed, the vitual must be
defined as strictly part of the real object– as though the object has
one part of itself in the virtual into which it plunged as through
into an objective dimension… The reality of the virtual consists of
the differential elements and relations along with the singular points
which correspond to them. The reality of the virtual is structure.&quot;
(Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy, p.30)
