 <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Cisler faleceu h&amp;aacute; poucos dias. Eu cheguei a trocar muitos e-mails e uma liga&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o telef&amp;ocirc;nica com ele. Mais um de quem muita gente vai sentir falta. Tem algumas homenagens a ele acontecendo pela web. Recebi h&amp;aacute; pouco da lista nettime:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;There is a new blog for condolences and memories about Steve Cisler,&lt;br /&gt; who passed last week.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://communitynetworking2008.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://communitynetworking2008&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He served on the board of the Internet Society, and was among the&lt;br /&gt; first people lobbying for the allocation of radio spectrum for&lt;br /&gt; wireless computer networks-an effort that led to the establishment of&lt;br /&gt; the 802.11b standard commonly used today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He worked for the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at&lt;br /&gt; Santa Clara University on a project to network the Tech Award&lt;br /&gt; Laureates (25 each year) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://techawards.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://techawards.org/&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 to the&lt;br /&gt; present. They have a photo and article up about his work at http://&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scu.edu/sts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.scu.edu/sts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Steve was extremely well-known in community networking movements&lt;br /&gt; around the globe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Steve was a Senior Scientist at Apple Library for many years and ran&lt;br /&gt; the Apple Library of Tomorrow project, which made grants to places as&lt;br /&gt; diverse as the Pueblo of Zuni and the Library of Congress.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A frequent conference speaker, he was also admired for his pithy trip&lt;br /&gt; reports about travel to some remote (and not so remote) community&lt;br /&gt; networking efforts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He also served in the Peace Corps and in the US Coast Guard.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A memorial celebration is planned for June 2 in the San Jose area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
